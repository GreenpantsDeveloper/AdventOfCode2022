# Advent of Code - 2022

You are looking at my participation of the Advent of Code hackathon of December 2022. Each folder corresponds with a day in December matching the Advent of Code challenges for that day. I am using my favourite languages: English and Python.

If you have any questions and/or remarks, be sure to let me know! Note that the code in this repository has been optimized for efficient programming in order to finish the challenges quickly, not necessarily for readability or maintainability. My actual, professional development may not reflect this style ;-).
